Detecting Human Fear in Electronic Trading: Emotional Quantum Entanglement
All credit to Pawel Lachowicz, PhD. Quantitative Risk Analyst with Bank of New York Mellon.

  By analysing the US stock market between 1960 and 1990, we estimate a human engagement (human factor) in live trading decisions taken after 2000. We find a clear distinction between 2000-2002 「dot-era」 trading behaviour and 2007-2008 crisis. By the use of peculiar data samples, we support their usefulness being motivated by recent discoveries in quantum physics helping us to better understand the physics of human thoughts and shared emotions when related to the same topic, here, the fear of losing.
